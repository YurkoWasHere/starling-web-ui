    <h1>Embed a web archive</h1>
    <p>
      Using the built-in WACZ embed from Webrecorder is simple. The
      documentation is available
      <a href="https://replayweb.page/docs/embedding">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's an example embed. You can view the source of this page to see how
      it's done.
    </p>
    <replay-web-page
      style="height: 500px"
      source="tweet-example.wacz"
      url="https://oembed.link/https://twitter.com/webrecorder_io/status/1565881026215219200"
    ></replay-web-page>
    <p>
      It's not mentioned in the docs yet, but Firefox has a some stricter CORS
      requirements than Google Chrome due to a bug. So if you are loading a WACZ
      file from a different origin than your UI, you will need to serve that
      file with the appropriate CORS headers to support Firefox.

      Make sure the server actually responds to <code>OPTIONS</code> requests.
